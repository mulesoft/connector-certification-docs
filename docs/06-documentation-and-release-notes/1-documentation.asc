== Documentation & Release Notes
Documentation is a vital part of the development stage. Your development team must strictly follow Mulesoft documentation standards described in this document.

=== Built-in Documentation

Part of the documentation must be packaged within the connector source code. The mandatory files are:

. User Guide
. Release Notes
. README

In addition, create a folder named *\_images* for image resources used in the documentation, one called __attachments_ for user-downloadable content such as a JSON file or WSDL XML file, and one called __sources_ for management of any code samples presented in the connector documentation, especially those which have associated Mule flow screenshots. It is important to give the corresponding image and Mule XML code the same name. The only thing that should differ are the file extensions, for example, connector-flow`.img` and connector-flow`.xml`.

=== User Guide

The user guide needs to be fully descriptive and easy to read, including not only technical documentation but use cases and error solutions. Write the documentation using AsciiDoc syntax so that the resulting file is called _user-manual.adoc_. Closely follow the template found link:files/user-manual.adoc[here].
It should reside in _doc_ folder in the root of the connector project.


=== Release Notes

Release notes need to be highly descriptive, including backward compatibility of the released connector with previous versions. Closely follow the template found link:files/release-notes.adoc[here].
It should reside in _doc_ folder in the root of the connector project.

=== README

A README.md template can be found link:files/README.md[here]. It should reside in the root of the connector project.

=== Connector APIdoc

Each connector requires:

. A description that provides a clear and a complete explanation of its purpose.
. XML samples of connector Configs (connection configurations) and Processors (the code that backs connector operations)
. Attributes that affect connector method behavior must be documented in detail.
