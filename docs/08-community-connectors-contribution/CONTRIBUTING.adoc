:keywords: community, connectors, contributing

Thank you! Really, thank you for taking some of your precious time
helping improve the *MuleSoft Anypoint Connectors*.

This guide will help you get started with the Anypoint Connector development
environment. You will also learn the set of rules you are expected to
follow in order to submit improvements and/or fixes to these projects.

[[before-you-begin]]
Before You Begin
----------------

MuleSoft's Anypoint Connectors can range from very simple to very complex
projects. Before contributing code to them, it is important to
*understand the domain of the target system* that the connector is going
to communicate with.

Also, it is essential to have some knowledge of the
link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.7/index[Anypoint Connector DevKit], which is the backbone of the connector. We advise you to become familiar with the link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.7/connector-testing-framework[Connector Testing Framework], especially if you are creating new functionality that needs
to be tested using that framework.

Lastly, having some *experience working
with the *Anypoint platform* is a big advantage. We will give you some pointers to get started on each of these topics.

[[starting-points]]
Starting Points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are many resources available to help you become familiar with Mule and its features:

* http://mulesoft.github.io/mule-cookbook-tutorial/[MuleSoft Cookbook
Tutorial], a step-by-step guide for getting started with Connector
Development.
* The official documentation around the usage of the link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.7/index[Anypoint Connector DevKit].
* The official documentation for the link:c/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.7/connector-testing-framework[Connector Testing Framework].
* link:m/mule-user-guide/v/3.7/index[Mule User Guide], the official documentation for Mule ESB.
* The books link:http://www.manning.com/dossot2/[MuleSoft in Action (2nd
Edition)] and link:http://shop.oreilly.com/product/0636920025726.do[Getting
Started with MuleSoft Cloud Connect]. Both are excellent resources for learning how to use and extend Mule.
* MuleSoft's link:http://blogs.mulesoft.com/[blog]. The fastest way to learn about the new features in Anypoint Platform.

[[visiting-the-community-meeting-points]]
Visiting the Community Meeting Points
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you have gotten this far, you probably already have
a new feature or a bug fix in mind to work on. This is great! Note, however, that there
could be other members of the community with the same idea.

Before you begin, please take a few minutes to review community meeting
points to make sure someone else hasn't already taken on your challenge:

. Search for *existing GitHub issues* to see if a bug or feature request has already been submitted.
. Follow the http://forums.mulesoft.com/topics/anypoint%20connector%20devkit.html[MuleSoft Forum]
chatter to see if anyone else has started resolving the problem or initiated an improvement.
. Scan http://stackoverflow.com/questions/tagged/mule[StackOverflow] to see if there is already a proposed solution to your problem.

If no one else has made your
improvement or fix in the above-listed resources, log the issue by creating a **GitHub tracking
issue**.

[[understanding-the-extension-mechanisms]]
Understanding the Extension Mechanisms
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Mule ESB* has two different extension mechanisms for writing modules and connectors.
Avoiding adding functionality to the project. Rather, using one of the mechanisms to extend Mule is probably the more favorable option.
It is important to understand both.

The *first* and more intuitive mechanism for extensions is the link:/anypoint-connector-devkit/v/3.7/index[Anypoint Connector DevKit], an *annotation based framework* for easy construction
of extensions. This is the one we will be focusing on in this document.

The *second* choice is to extend Mule through the
link:/mule-fundamentals/v/3.7/extending-mule[Extensions]
mechanism.

[[setting-up-the-development-environment]]
Setting up the Development Environment
--------------------------------------

While getting ready to contribute to any piece of software, there are
several *prerequisite components* you will have to install. Plus, you
will need to obtain the *preexisting source code* there may exist.

This section provides some guidelines for installing those components and downloading the source code.

[[installing-prerequisites]]
Installing Prerequisites
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Before you get started, you need to set yourself up with an environment in which to develop Anypoint Connectors. Your dev environment needs a few things:

* A **Java SDK**.
* A recent version of **Maven**.
* A development environment tool or *IDE* (most preferably Anypoint Studio with DevKit plugin installed).
* A new *branch* of code to work on.

[[java]]
=== Java

. If you are working with *Windows* or **Linux**, install one of the
following
link:http://www.oracle.com/technetwork/java/javase/downloads/index.html[Java
Development Kits] on your local drive.

. If you are working on a **Mac**,
simply confirm that the JDK shipped with your Mac OS X is _Java SE
Development Kit 7 (also known as Java SE)_ or newer using the command
`java -version`. Then skip to step 4 below.

. Create an environment variable called `JAVA_HOME`, setting it to the directory in which you installed the JDK.

. Update the `PATH` environment variable so that it includes the path to JDK binaries. Add the following to the `PATH` variable:


* On *Windows*
+
```
%JAVA_HOME%/bin
```

* On *Linux or Mac OS X*
+
```
$JAVA_HOME/bin
```

[[maven]]
=== Maven

1.  Download the Maven distribution from the
link:http://maven.apache.org/download.cgi[Maven web site], then unpack it to
a convenient folder on your local drive.
2.  Create an environment variable called `M2_HOME`, then set it to the
folder into which you unpacked Maven.
3.  Update the `PATH` environment variable to include the path to Maven
binaries:
* On *Windows*
+
```
%M2_HOME%/bin
```
* On *Linux or Mac OS X*
+
```
$M2_HOME/bin
```

[[getting-the-source-code]]
Getting the Source Code
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*MuleSoft Community Connectors* source code lives on **GitHub**. Perform
the following procedure to locate the code and get it onto your local drive.

If you are new to Git, consider reading http://git-scm.com/book[Pro Git] to learn the basics. Want a read-only version of the source code?

1.  link:link:https://help.github.com/articles/signing-up-for-a-new-github-account[Create] or log in to your GitHub account.
2.  If you haven't already done so, link:https://help.github.com/articles/set-up-git[set up Git] on your local
drive.
3.  Navigate to link:https://github.com/mulesoft[*MuleSoft's
GitHub Connector*] page and select one of the repositories listed. For example, the link:https://github.com/mulesoft/twitter-connector.git[*Twitter Connector*].
[.center.text-center]
image:images/cc_fork.png[Fork]
4.  Click the *Fork* button at the top right corner of the page, then select your own git repository into which GitHub inserts a copy.
5.  Prepare to *Clone* your forked repository from your GitHub account to your local drive via a secure file transfer connection. As per GitHub recommendation, we recommend using HTTPS to transfer the source code files
to your local drive. However, if you prefer to establish a secure connection for transferring the files via SSH, follow GitHub procedure to link:https://help.github.com/articles/generating-ssh-keys[generate SSH keys].
6.  From the **command line**, create or navigate to an existing folder on your local drive into which you wish to store your forked clone of the connector source code.
7.  Then, execute one of the following:
* For *HTTPS*
+
```
git clone https://github.com/<username>/<repo-name>
```

* For *SSH*
+
```
git clone git@github.com:<username>/<repo-name>.git
```

8.  Add the *upstream repository* so that you can pull changes and stay updated with changes to the connector code branch. From the command line, execute one of the following:
* For *HTTPS*
+
```
git remote add upstream https://github.com/mulesoft/<repo-name>.git
```

* For *SSH*
+
```
git remote add upstream git@github.com:mulesoft/<repo-name>.git
```

NOTE: Read more about how to
link:https://help.github.com/articles/fork-a-repo/[Fork a Repo] on GitHub.

[[understanding-the-build]]
=== Understanding the Build

This is a great moment to stop and read the
http://mulesoft.github.io/mule-cookbook-tutorial/[MuleSoft Cookbook
Tutorial]. A correct understanding of *how a Anypoint Connector project
is organized and built* is key to a productive development process.

We are ready to develop and implement our improvements. But, instead of doing it manually, we may want to configure an IDE for enhanced productivity. We
will expand on this in the next section.

[[configuring-the-ide]]
== Configuring the IDE

This section offers tips for importing and working on connector source code in **Anypoint Studio**. There are no restrictions on the type of integration development environment you use to develop Anypoint Connectors. We simply opted for the **Anypoint Studio with
DevKit plugin installed**, which is the preferred choice since it adds a lot of support tools.

[[working-with-anypoint-studio]]
=== Working with Anypoint Studio

Use Anypoint Studio to modify or add to your cloned version of the connector source code.

[[importing]]
==== Importing

. Download and install
link:https://www.mulesoft.com/platform/studio[Anypoint Studio] on your local
drive.
. Launch it.
. Install **Anypoint DevKit Plugin**.

* From the *Help* menu in Anypoint Studio, click **Install New Software**.
* Open the *Work with* drop-down menu and select the **Anypoint Addons Update Site**.
+
NOTE: If the Anypoint Addons Update Site is not available in the dropdown list, click *Add* and then *copy* the following URL to the repository
location: _*http://studio.mulesoft.org/r4/addons/beta*_

* Check the *Anypoint DevKit Plugin* option and click **Next**.
* Proceed through the remaining steps in the wizard to install.
* Restart Studio.

. Select *File > Import*.
. In the *Import* wizard, click to expand the *Anypoint Studio*
folder, then select **Anypoint Connector Project from External
Location**, then click **Next**.
. In the *Select root directory* field, use the *Browse* button to
navigate to the directory into which you downloaded the cloned fork of the source code from your GitHub account.
. Ensure the project is checked, then click *Finish* and wait for Studio to import the source code. This step may take a while as it needs to download all dependencies from the Maven repository.
. Open source code files when you need to edit or add content.
. Click the *Save* icon to save locally.

[[testing]]
==== Testing

Use Maven to run unit tests on your project using the command:

```
mvn test
```

In addition to the unit tests, the Anypoint Connector project is
normally packaged with a handful of functional tests. These tests are
part of a *JUnit Test Suite*, called __FunctionalTestSuite__.

To run these tests, you can use the following command:

```
mvn test -Dtest=FunctionalTestSuite
```

On occasion, some tests (that are not testing processors on the connector) require connectivity to the external system. These would be bundled together in a special test suite called SystemTestSuite. You can run those tests with:

```
mvn test -Dtest=SystemTestSuite
```

In these last two cases, you need to provide a file containing the
credentials that allow the connector to talk to the remote system.
Place a file named `automation-credentials.properties` in the
`src/test/resources` folder in your project. This file is "Git-ignored" and
should never be added to the repository.

NOTE: Read more about
link:http://mulesoft.github.io/connector-certification-docs/advanced/index.html#_functional_tests_automation[MuleSoft's
Testing Conventions].

[[setting-startup-parameters]]
==== Setting Startup Parameters

The table below lists a number of command-line parameters you can use to
alter Anypoint Studio startup behavior, if you wish to. Simply edit the
bundled file `AnypointStudio.ini`.

[cols="1,4",options="header"]
|===
|Parameter|Action
|`-clean`|Enables clean registration of plug-in (some plug-ins do not always register themselves properly after a restart).
|`-nosplash`|Does not show Anypoint Studio or plug-in splash screens.
|`-showlocation`|Allows you to explicitly set which JDK to use.
|`-vm`|Examples that come with the full Mule distribution.
|`-vmargs`|Allows you to pass in standard VM arguments.
|===

[[developing-your-contribution]]
== Developing Your Contribution

Working directly on the `*master*` version of source code is *strongly discouraged*, since it would
likely result in *merge conflicts* with the original `*master*` repository. Instead, the recommended approach for contributing to any source code is to host your changes in the
`*feature*` branch. Anypoint Connector code is developed following the
*GitFlow* branching model.

NOTE: The articles link:http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/[A successful Git branching model] (by Vincent Driessen) and link:http://www.clock.co.uk/blog/release-management-with-gitflow-the-clock-way/[Release Management with Gitflow] (by Paul Serby) provide excellent starting points for getting familiar with *GitFlow*.

[[creating-your-feature-branch]]
=== Creating Your Feature Branch

Open a command line window and perform the following steps:

* From your local drive, position on `*develop*` branch:
+
```
git checkout develop
```

* Create a new branch in which you can work on your bug fix or improvement using the command:
+
```
git checkout -b feature/yourGitHubIssueNumber
```

Now you should be able to compile your very first version of the connector source code. Unless you are using Anypoint Studio, you need only to instruct Maven to download all the libraries that are dependencies
and compile the project, which can be achieved by executing the following command in the directory into which you cloned the source code:

```
mvn -DskipTests package
```

NOTE: If this is your first time using Maven, the download may take several minutes to complete.

Now that you are all set with a local development environment and your own branch of the source code, you're ready get going!

The following steps briefly outline the development life-cycle to follow in order to develop and commit your changes in **preparation for submission**.

* If you are using Anypoint Studio, make sure you read the previous section about link:#configuring-the-ide[IDE configuration].
* Make sure you *format* your source code using the
link:https://github.com/mulesoft/connector-certification-docs/blob/develop/docs/02-coding-standards-best-practices/files/connectors-style-convention.xml[Formatting settings]. This is to ensure you **adhere
to source code standards**, thus increasing the likelihood that your
changes will be merged into the connector source code.
* *Import* the source code project into Anypoint Studio (or your IDE of
choice), then work on your changes, fixes or improvements.
* *Debug* and test your local version, resolving any issues that arise.
* *Save* your changes locally.
* *Prepare* your changes for a _Pull Request_ by first squashing your changes into a single commit on your branch using the command:
+
```
git rebase -i
```
* *Push* your squashed commit to your branch on your GitHub repository.
Refer to
http://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Git-Basics-Recording-Changes-to-the-Repository[Git's
documentation] for details on how to commit your changes.
* *Regularly update your branch* with any changes or fixes applied to
the `*develop*` branch (remember this is the repository that will contain the latest changes of the connector). Refer to details below.

[[updating-your-feature-branch]]
=== Updating Your Feature Branch

To ensure that your cloned version of source code remains *up-to-date*
with any changes uploaded to the connector branch, you
should regularly update your branch to *rebase* off of the latest version
of the `*develop*`.

* *Pull* the latest changes from the _upstream_ `*develop*` branch using the following commands:

```
git fetch upstream
git fetch upstream --tags
```

* *Merge* the latest changes and updates from the `*develop*` branch to
your feature branch using the following command:

```
git merge upstream/develop
```

* *Push* any changes of `*develop*` branch to your forked clone using the
following commands:

```
git push origin feature/yourGitHubIssueNumber
git push origin --tags
```

* Access your `*feature*` branch once again (to continue coding), using the command:

```
git checkout dev/yourRepoName/bug/yourGitHubIssueNumber
```

* *Rebase* your branch from the latest version of `*develop*` branch using
the following command:

```
git rebase develop
```

* *Resolve* any conflicts on your feature branch that may appear.

* *Push* the newly-rebased branch back to your fork on your git repository using the following command:

```
git push origin dev/yourRepoName/feature/yourGitHubIssueNumber -f
```

[[summary]]
== Summary

This guide started with pointing to different
link:#getting-to-know-better-mule[sources of information] around
MuleSoft and the Mule's
link:#visiting-the-community-meeting-points[community meeting points] on
the web. These were useful for understanding where MuleSoft is going and to have contact with the rest of the community for help or to spark discussion.

In order to set up our
link:#setting-up-the-development-environment[development environment],
we went to link:#installing-prerequisites[install some prerequisites].
Once we had those ready, we downloaded the
link:#getting-the-source-code[source code].

At that point we were almost ready to develop our improvements. We just
needed to link:#configuring-the-ide[configure Anypoint Studio] to
develop or debug MuleSoft Anypoint Connector code.

Afterwards, we were ready to link:#developing-your-contribution[develop
our contribution]: we created our very own
link:#creating-your-feature-branch[feature branch] to develop the
improvement and we learned how to link:#updating-your-feature-branch[keep
it updated] in order to submit a link:#submitting-a-pull-request[pull
request] to the main MuleSoft Anypoint Conntectors repository.
