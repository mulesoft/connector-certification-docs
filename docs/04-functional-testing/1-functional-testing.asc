== Tests Automation

This section explains how to automate test cases for Anypoint MuleSoft Connectors. Tests are _Functional Tests_, _System Tests_ or _Unit Tests_ depending which aspect of the connector is being tested.

Functional tests aim at testing the connector with a particular Mule runtime environment, thus assuring backward and forward compatibility. System tests group those aspects were a connection is needed but no underlying Mule runtime, such as when testing valid/invalid credentials or different connection strategies. Finally, unit tests aim at verifying isolated components, or units, of the connector which do not require a valid connection nor a Mule runtime.

Once all tests have been engineered, a final test execution step is required. This execution step requires to run Functional tests with different Mule runtimes configurations, run System tests with valid/invalid credentials and finally run unit tests.


=== How to Start?

There are different aspects to tests:

1. *Processors:* For each processor, a functional test is required.
2. *MetaData:* MetaData requires as well a functional test, employing a slightly different approach than processors.
3. *Pagination:* If the connector implements @Paged processors, then pagination need to be tested.
4. *Test Connectivity:* Every connection strategy need to be tested with valid/invalid credentials.
5. *WSDL Operations:* Testing WSDL operations is required *ONLY* when your connector is SOAP Connect. As with MetaData, testing these kind of operations require a different approach than processors.

For functional tests, DevKit Plugin generates functional tests scaffolding, as explained https://developer.mulesoft.com/docs/display/current/Developing+DevKit+Connector+Tests[here]. This scaffolding generates a functional test per available processor, which covers the functional testing part. System and Unit tests need to be written entirely from scratch.


=== Best Practices

Before starting, there are a few best practices when engineering test cases:

1. Always clean the connector sandbox after running either Functional or System tests.
2. *setup():* If @Before behaviour is required, this method must be defined and annotated accordingly.
3. *tearDown():* If @After behaviour is required, this method must be defined and annotated accordingly. Normally all _cleaning behaviour_ regarding the sandbox should go here.
4. *.gitignore:* Automations credentials and any sensitive data should be added to this file to avoid any mistake when committing the connector project.

=== Functional Tests

Functional tests aim at assuring the correct behaviour of the connector within a particular Mule runtime environment, particular testing how well the connector integrates with Mule architecture.

Functional testing is a _mandatory_ step within the certification process and need to be carried out following strict practices, who are detailed throughout this section.

=== System Tests

This category must group all those tests that *required a connection*. All those tests that are not functional, but require a connection must go within this category.

==== Test Organization

System tests need to be engineered and organized as follows:

. *Test Suites:* _org.mule.modules.<connector-project>.automation.runner.SystemTestSuite_ groups all System tests with no exception. In case two or more test suites are required (when grouping semantic similar tests for instance), a _FullSystemTestSuite_ need to be used, grouping the remaining test suites.
. *Naming Convention:* System tests must end with _TestCases_. Employing alternatives ending names is discouraged, specially endings such as _Test_ or _TestCase_.
. *Test Categories:* Tests categories might be used if needed, although are discouraged. However, if used, they need to be named as _SystemTest.class_.

TIP: When not using test categories, a test suite might use *@RunWith(Suite.class)* before the list of classes within the suite itself. Thus, all listed test classes are executed and any test category is needed.

==== Packages and Files

System test files need to be kept in specific packages as follows:

. *org.mule.modules.<connector-project>.automation.system* contains the system test cases exclusively.

==== Topic to Tests with System Tests

1. *Test Connectivity:* These tests aim at running the _TestConnectivity_ operation by covering the internal logic of the method itself, which differs from testing the annotation used. A single test case is accepted, named as _ConnectivitySystemTestCases_, which will contains as many tests as set of credentials are used. These tests need to be named as <CredentialsName>ConnectivityTest.

===== Test Connectivity

These tests aim at testing the logic under the @TestConnectivity annotated method. To do so, let's consider the following connector example and its connection strategy.

[source,java]
----
@ConnectionManagement(friendlyName="CookBookConnector Connection", configElementNam="cookbookconfig")
public class CookBookConnectionManagementStrategy{

  @Connect
  public void connect(@ConnectionKey String username, @Password String password){
     ...
  }

  @TestConnectivity
  public void testConnectivity(@ConnectionKey String username, @Password String password){

    //Always call the connect method somewhere within the @TestConnectivity method
    this.connect(username, password);

    //Add extra behaviour when testing the connection
  }
...
}
----

In order to test this connection strategy, the following test is required:

[source,java]
----

import
public class ConnectivitySystemTestCases {

  private Properties validCredentials;

  private static final String CREDENTIALS_SYSTEM_PROPERTY = "automation-credentials.properties";

  private static final Logger logger = Logger.getLogger(ConnectivitySystemTestCases.class);

  @Before
  public void setup(){

    validCredentials = ConfigurationUtils.getAutomationCredentialsProperties();;
  }


   @Test
   public void validCredentialsConnectivityTest throws Exception {

    //Add required extra behaviour here if necessary

    CookBookConnectionManagementStrategy connectorStrategy = new CookBookConnectionManagementStrategy();

    String username = validCredentials.getProperty("cookbookconfig.username");
    String password = validCredentials.getProperty("cookbookconfig.password");

    //Call the @TestConnectivity
    connectorStrategy.testConnectivity(username, password);
   }

   @Test
   public void invalidCredentialsConnectivityTest throws Exception {

    //Add required extra behaviour here if necessary

    CookBookConnectionManagementStrategy connectorStrategy = new CookBookConnectionManagementStrategy();

    //Call the @TestConnectivity
    connectorStrategy.testConnectivity("noUserName", "noPassword");
   }

   @Test
   public void nullCredentialsConnectivityTest throws Exception {

    //Add required extra behaviour here if necessary

    CookBookConnectionManagementStrategy connectorStrategy = new CookBookConnectionManagementStrategy();

    //Call the @TestConnectivity
    connectorStrategy.testConnectivity(null, null);
   }
}
----

Note that in this case, the _automation-credentials.properties_ file is formed by _<configName>.<placeholder>=<value>_. In this example we have as config name (defined by _configElementName_ paramenter) *cookbookconfig*. This file always goes within _src/test/resources_.

IMPORTANT: The valid credentials need to be the same as with the functional tests, in this case _automation-credentials.properties_.

Connectivity tests need to tests as many scenarios as possible, such as invalid credentials, null parameters, etc.

TIP: _ConfigurationUtils.Java class_ is available from link:files/ConfigurationUtils.java[here]. Include it in your connector project.

=== Unit Tests

Unit tests aim at assuring the correct behaviour of a particular code unit within the connector. Although not a mandatory step within the certification process, different aspects require unit tests instead of functional tests.

==== Test Organization

Functional tests need to be engineered and organized as follows:

. *Test Suites:* Tests suites are not required for unit tests.
. *Naming Convention:* Unit tests should follow JUnit naming conventions, normally ending with _Test_ or _TestCase_. Any other ending will produce Maven Surfire plugin to skip these tests during installation.
. *Test Categories:* Tests categories are not required for unit tests.

==== Packages and Files

Test files need to be kept in specific packages as follows:

. *org.mule.modules.<connector-project>.automation.unit* contains the unit test cases exclusively.

CAUTION: Overriding package organization is only accepted if a unit test need to be contained within the same package of the class under tests, _i.e._ when the class has package visibility.

=== Test Execution

Once all tests have been engineered, they must be executed following a few guidelines:

1. *Functional Tests:* Functional tests must be executed with different Mule runtime environments, assuring the correct integration of the connector with older and current Mule runtimes.
2. *System Tests*: Connectivity tests need to be executed with valid and invalid credentials, covering both success and error cases.
3. *Unit Tests:* All unit tests need to be ran with _mvn tests_.

IMPORTANT: *mvn tests* must only run unit tests, since the remaining tests (Functional and System tests) need a valid connection and credentials. Without these credentials, tests will fail.

==== Running Functional Tests

The overall idea of functional tests is to assure backward and forward compatibility in every aspect of a connector. Therefore, the main goal is to execute the functional test suite in different Mule runtime environments.

===== Test SetUp

There are a few things to consider before running the functional test suite:

. *automation-credentials.properties:* This file stores the connector credentials and authenticated user related information. It is mandatory to have this file within src/test/resources.
. *required-libraries.properties:* This file stores the list of required external Jars or native libraries.

Both these files need to be stored within *<connector-project>/src/test/resources* for running the functional test suite.

IMPORTANT: Be careful of excluding these files when committing changes.

The _required-libraries.properties_ files is only required if external, or native, libraries are required, as explained https://developer.mulesoft.com/docs/display/current/Creating+an+Anypoint+Connector+Project#CreatinganAnypointConnectorProject-AddingNativeLibrariesandJARstoaConnectorBuild[here].

===== Required Test configurations

The connector must be tested with all available Mule runtimes environments from its _MinMuleVersion_ to the latest runtime (MinMuleVersion is a parameter specifying which is the minimum supported Mule runtime for a given connector).

. _Mule Runtimes:_ If a connector does not require an Enterprise Mule Runtime (_i.e._ it is not Premium nor Select) it must use *Mule Community Edition Runtimes*, such as 3.5.0, 3.6.0 or 3.7.0. Otherwise, it must use *Mule Enterprise Edition Runtimes*, such as 3.5.3 or 3.6.2.

. _Java Versions:_ Every Mule runtime environment needs to be bind with a particular Java version as follows: Mule runtimes 3.5.X must use Java 1.6, Mule runtimes 3.6.X must use Java 1.7 and Mule runtimes 3.7.X must use Java 1.8. This can be achieved by configuring the _wrapper.comf_ file within the Mule runtime _conf_ directory.

===== Testing using CTF

The Connector Testing Framework allows to run test suites in a specific Mule runtime environment, as explained https://github.com/mulesoft/connector-testing-framework[here].

Two extra test properties need to be added when running a test suite from the command line:

. Deployment Profile: By using _-Ddeploymentprofile=local_, CTF will run the test suite in a remote Mule runtime environment.
. Mule Directory: By using _-Dmuledirectory:<mule-directory>_, CTF will use the available mule runtime to run a test suite if _-Ddeploymentprofile=local_ is used.
